      - Cotija cheese, crumbled
      - More cilantro for topping (optional)
      - Lime wedges (optional)
      - Tortilla chips
Instructions:
  - Prepare Marinade. Place chicken in a gallon ziploc bag. Add all marinade ingredients and zip closed. Massage chicken with the marinade and put in fridge for at least 6 hours.
  - Make Corn Salsa. Toss all ingredients together in a large bowl. Best if allowed to sit in fridge for at least 30 minutes - 1 hour before serving. (Can be made in advance)
  - Make Crema. Mix together all ingredients for the cilantro lime crema. Refrigerate until ready to serve. (Can be made in advance)
  - Grill Chicken. Place marinated chicken tenderloins on heated grill (~400F). Cook approx. 3-4 per side (flipping once) until done. Place on cutting board and allow to set for a couple of minutes. Then chop up chicken into small pieces.
  - Warm up corn tortillas on low heat on griddle (both sides). Keep warm by wrapping in paper towels on a plate. Alternately, you can wrap up small stacks of corn tortillas in paper towels, put on a plate, and microwave for ~30 seconds.
  - Serve up! Assemble tacos with chicken, crema, corn salsa and cotija cheese in the warmed corn tortillas. Garnish with extra cilantro and squeezes of fresh lime juice if desired. You can also eat the corn salsa with tortilla chips.
