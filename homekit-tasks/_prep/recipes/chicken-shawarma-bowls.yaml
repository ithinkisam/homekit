Components:
  - Name: Chicken marinade
    Ingredients:
      - 2 lemons juiced
      - ½ cup olive oil
      - 6 cloves garlic peeled, smashed and minced
      - Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
      - 2 teaspoons ground cumin
      - 2 teaspoons paprika
      - ½ teaspoon dried oregano
      - ½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
      - 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs
  - Name: Bowls
    Ingredients:
      - 3 heads Romaine Lettuce Shredded
      - ½ cup chopped Parsley
      - 1 pint cherry Tomatoes halved
      - 4 Persian Cucumbers diced
      - 1 cup homemade Tzatziki
      - Homemade Toasted Pita Chips
Instructions:
  - In a large zip-top bag, combine the lemon juice, ½ cup olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, oregano and red-pepper flakes. Add the chicken, zip the top of the bag and give it a quick shake to combine. Refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.
  - Preheat a cast iron to medium high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and grill each chicken thigh for 4-5 minutes on each side until done. Remove and set aside to rest.
  - Slice the chicken against the grain into thin strips and transfer back into the skillet and sauté for 2 minutes until just slightly crispy around the edges.
  - Transfer the chicken to a large bowl and toss to combine with the parsley, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers.
  - Divide the shredded lettuce amongst 4 bowls and top with a hefty portion of the chicken tomato mixture. Drizzle wtih tzatziki or serve it on the side. Also pita chips on the side.
Notes:
  - Keep more tzatziki on the side when you serve, and definitely make or buy pita chips!
