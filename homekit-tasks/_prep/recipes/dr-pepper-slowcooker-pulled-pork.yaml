Equipment:
  - 6 quart slowcooker
Components:
  - Ingredients:
      - 1 pork butt/pork shoulder roast 4-5 pounds
      - salt, pepper, & garlic powder
      - 1 onion sliced, optional
      - 1 can Dr. Pepper
      - ¾ cup barbecue sauce or to taste
      - Rolls & coleslaw for serving
Instructions:
  - Place the onion in the bottom of the slow cooker. Rub the outside of the roast with salt, pepper and garlic powder.
  - Pour the Dr. Pepper over the pork and cook on high 4-5 hours or on low 7-8 hours.
  - The meat will be very tender. Using 2 forks, shred the pork and place back in the juices.
  - Add barbecue sauce to taste. Allow to cook an additional 30-60 minutes if desired.
  - Serve on crusty rolls with coleslaw.
Notes:
  - Rootbeer or cola can be substituted for Dr. Pepper. Diet Dr. Pepper will work in this recipe.
  - A larger roast will need extra cooking time.
  - If you check the pork and it is not tender, it likely needs more time so cover it back up and let it keep cooking.
  - If your pork produces a lot of juice remove some of the juices before adding the shredded pork back into the mixture. We like to stir in additional BBQ sauce before serving.
  - Pork can be kept warm in the slow cooker.
